Please configure the app with your custodial wallet credentials, as well as your Fauna secret key and XUMM developer credentials before using.

In this folder, there are several Next.js API routes that demonstrate significant XRPL functionality. Please use this source code to learn how to perform NFToken operations such as as minting, transferring, and creating buy/sell offers.
